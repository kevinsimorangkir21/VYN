During my internship at Telkom Witel Lampung under the BGES MBB division, I was given the opportunity to work collaboratively with Ignatius Krisna Issaputra on several projects that combined both data analysis and web development.

One of our primary tasks was conducting data analysis on Indibiz installations in the Lampung region, covering the period from January 2023 to June 2024. For this, we utilized SQL integrated with PHP to process, analyze, and generate meaningful insights from customer and installation data. This experience strengthened my ability to handle real-world data and translate it into actionable information.

Together, we also developed a customer data analysis dashboard website called “Kedaton Connect” for the Telkom Akses Kedaton sector. The project followed the Waterfall method as the workflow framework, and we divided the responsibilities into Front-End and Back-End development. Working as a team allowed me to sharpen not only my technical skills but also my collaboration and communication abilities in a professional setting.

In addition to technical contributions, the internship also provided opportunities for in-depth learning about Telkom Indonesia’s organizational structure, its workflows, and the interconnection with several related parent companies. This broadened my understanding of how a large-scale telecommunications company operates, bridging the gap between academic theory and professional industry practice.
